    //ANSWER: Had to put vc.selectedPictureNumber = indexPath.row + 1 in override func in ViewController. This adds one 1 to the first row and counts from there.
    //Then below that had to put vc.totalPictures = pictures.count This counts all the pictures in the array and gives you 1 of 10. Was also found in Apple Documentation as a method.

   // selectedPictureNumber = pictures[indexPath.row] didn't work use of unresolved identifiers (pictures)
